# JavaScript Basics 👶
# Javascript is a programming language which was created for making web pages dynamic and more interactive to the user
1)It was created to make web pages more interactive and dynamic.
2)Initially javascript was created to run and execute inside browsers , thats why it is called as Client Side Programming page
# A programming language can be classified into two types i.e., Client side language and Server Side Language
# Client side language : 
It requires browsers to run the program executed on browser

# Server Side Language:
It is use to process recieved data on server and sends the results back to client i.e., browser executed on server

Let's start off with some basic concepts every JS developer needs to know.
## ** Client side Responsibilties
1) Construction HTML Page
2) Validating HTML page
3) Converting the frontend object into JSON?XML
4) Rendering server response to HTML
## Variables in JavaScript 📥
Variables are the building blocks of every programming language. You use them to store values. A variable can be a number, string, and many other types.

Now, JS is a loosely-typed language. You don't have to state the type of variable. You can just declare it, and JS will figure it out on its own.

Now, in JavaScript we have 3 ways to declare variables: var, let, and const.

Here are the key differences:

![image](https://github.com/AwaizMd/Notes/assets/72355688/9b6e8fb7-dece-4d49-b3d5-f9ff4c74205e)
 

**Let's try to understand them through examples.**

We will cover scope later on. For now, let's focus on the other differences.
``` javascript
var a =1;
let b =2;
const c = 3;

function dummy(){
    var d = 4;
    let e = 5;  // let is blocked scope
    e = 8; // can be updated
    const f = 6;
    f = 9; // cannot update it will throw ->  Assignment to constant variable.
    if(d==4){
        var g = 7;  // var is global scope but can be accessed inside this function itself not outside this function, its more like function-scoped.
        var g = 10 // can be re declared
        let h = 8; // let is blocked scope it can be accessed only in this block, not in this whole function like var.
        let h = 18;// can't be re declared
        const i = 9;
        const i = 9;// can't be re declared
    }
    console.log(g) // can be accessed out of the block
    console.log(h)// can't be accessed out of the block
    console.log(i)// can't be accessed out of the block
}
dummy()
console.log(a)
console.log(b)
console.log(c)
console.log(d)
console.log(e)
console.log(f)
```

Note: *In JavaScript, putting a semi-colon after the end of statement is optional. I will be skipping it here for the sake of readability.*

## == vs === in JavaScript
Let's compare some variables. There are two ways you can do that.

== only checks for the value

=== checks for value + type

``` javascript
let a = 5 // number
let b = '5' // string

console.log(a == b) // true

console.log(a === b) // false

```

## ** Falsy values in javascript are :: false,0,-0,"",null,undefined,NaN
## Nullish operator
In JavaScript, the nullish coalescing operator (??) is a logical operator that returns the right-hand side operand when the left-hand side operand is either null or undefined. If the left-hand side operand is any other value, including false, 0, "", or other falsy values, it returns the left-hand side operand. This makes it distinct from the logical OR (||) operator, which returns the right-hand side operand if the left-hand side operand is falsy.
```js
const result = leftOperand ?? rightOperand;
```
If leftOperand is null or undefined, result will be rightOperand.
Otherwise, result will be leftOperand.
Example:
Here are some examples of how the nullish coalescing operator works:
```js
const x = 0; 
const y = 12;

let value = x ?? y;
let withor = x || y;

console.log(value) //0
console.log(withor) //12
```
## ** Optional Chaining (?.)
Safely accessing deeply nested properties in JavaScript can be tricky because trying to access a property on undefined or null results in a runtime error To handle this situation, we can use optional chaining (?.), which allows us to access properties without throwing an error if any part of the chain is undefined or null.
## ** Problem: Accessing Nested Properties**
Let’s say you have an object obj, and you want to access the property a.b.c. The issue is that if any part of the chain (a, b, or c) is undefined or null, accessing further down the chain will result in an error.

const obj = { a: { b: { c: 42 } } };
console.log(obj.a.b.c); // 42 output

This works fine because all parts of the chain (a, b, and c) exist
But what happens if a, b, or c is missing?

const obj2 = { a: { b: null } };
console.log(obj2.a.b.c); // Error: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'c')

Since b is null, trying to access b.c will throw an error
## ** Solution: Optional Chaining (?.) **
Optional chaining (?.) allows you to safely access deeply nested properties without worrying about errors if part of the chain is undefined or null. If any property in the chain is undefined or null, it will return undefined and stop the evaluation, preventing an error.

const obj2 = { a: { b: null } };
console.log(obj2?.a?.b?.c); // undefined (no error)

The key concept behind optional chaining is that it short-circuits the expression. As soon as it encounters a null or undefined, it stops the evaluation and returns undefined rather than continuing to access deeper properties.
## ** Other Use Cases
## ** Accessing array elements:
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(arr?.[1]); // 2
console.log(arr?.[5]); // undefined
## ** Calling methods

const obj = { greet: () => 'Hello' };
console.log(obj.greet?.()); // 'Hello'

const obj2 = { };
console.log(obj2.greet?.()); // undefined (no error)
  
## **Arrays in JavaScript**
Now that we know a bit about variables, let's move on to arrays and array-methods.

Array is a datastructure which allows to store a collection of items, such as numbers, strings, objects, or even other arrays. Arrays are useful for organizing and managing groups of related data.

```javascript

let a = 4
const b = 5
var c = 'hello'

const array = [a, b, c]

// or you can just directly do

const arr = [4,5,'hello']

```

But only storing variables in an array is kind of boring. We can do more stuff with this array (like accessing these variables or changing the order in which they are stored or how they are stored).

For that, JS has a lot of methods. Let's look at some of them now.


## JavaScript Array Methods 🧰
The most frequently used array methods in JS are: map, filter, find, reduce, and forEach.

Let's cover map, filter, and forEach. You can explore more in this helpful article.

**The map array method**
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-map-how-to-use-the-js-map-function-array-method/

map creates a new copy of the original array. We use it when we want to do something with the elements of the original array but don't want to change it.

map iterates over the original array and takes a callback function as an argument. In the callback function, we tell it what to do with the elements.

let a = [1,2,3];
let b = a.map(x => x*2);
console.log(a); // [1,2,3];
console.log(b); // [2,4,6]


``` javascript

const a = [1,2,3,4,5]

// Create a new array which multiplies every element by 2

const d = a.map(function(item){ return item*2 })

console.log(d) // [2,4,6,8,10]

```

**The filter array method**
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-array-filter-tutorial-how-to-iterate-through-elements-in-an-array/

filter creates a new array with elements that meet the given condition(s).

Let's look at an example. I have used arrow functions here. If you are a little uncomfortable with functions, you can cover the next section first and come back.

*Return the words with more than 6 letters*
```javascript
const words = ['react', 'script', 'interview', 'style', 'javascript']

const ans = words.filter((word) => word.length > 6)

console.log(ans) // ['interview', 'javascript']

```
Try to do the exercises yourself first to test your knowledge. If you come up with different or better solutions, let me know!

Generally, a follow up to this: can you do it without the array method?

```javascript
let newArr = []

for (let i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
  if (words[i].length > 6) {
    newArr.push(words[i])
  }
}
console.log(newArr)
```

**The forEach array method**

*It iterates over the elements of an array and execute a callback function for each element. It does not return a new array and does not modify the original array directly, but it can be used to perform operations that modify the elements of the array in place.*

forEach is very similar to map but has two key differences:

First of all, map returns a new Array, but forEach doesn't.

// Return a new array where even numbers are multiplied by 2 
```javascript
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

function consoleEven(arr) {
  let data = arr.map((num) => (num % 2 === 0 ? num * 2 : num * 1))
  
  console.log(data)  // [1,  4, 3, 8, 5, 12, 7]
}

// ? is the ternary operator. If the condition is true - first statement is returned otherwise the second one.


consoleEven(arr) 


function consoleEven(arr) {
  let data = arr.forEach((num) => (num % 2 === 0 ? num * 2 : num * 1))
  console.log(data) // undefined
}

consoleEven(arr)
And second, you can do method chaining in map but not in forEach.


// Convert  the new array back to original

function consoleEven(arr) {
  let data = arr
    .map((num) => (num % 2 === 0 ? num * 2 : num * 1))
    .map((item) => (item % 2 === 0 ? item / 2 : item / 1))
    
  console.log(data)
}
consoleEven(arr)
```
Note: map and forEach don't mutate (change) the original array.


**Reduce method**

**Purpose:** The reduce() method is used to process an array and produce a single output value. It "reduces" the array to a single value by applying a function you provide.

**Function:** The function provided to reduce() receives two primary arguments:
* An accumulator, which stores the current result of the reduction.
* The current element being processed from the array.
The function can also optionally receive the current index and the whole array.
**How It Works:**
* The reduce() method iterates through each element in the array.
* The function you provide calculates a new accumulator value using the current accumulator and the current element.
* The calculated accumulator value is passed on to the next iteration, and the process continues until all elements have been processed.
* Once the array has been processed, reduce() returns the final accumulator value as the result.
* Initial Value: The reduce() method can take an optional initial value for the accumulator. If you provide an initial value, the iteration starts with that value as the accumulator. If you don't 
  provide an initial value, the first element of the array is used as the initial accumulator, and the iteration starts from the second element.

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const sum = numbers.reduce((accumulator, currentElement) => {
    return accumulator + currentElement;
}, 0); // Initial accumulator value is 0

console.log(sum); // Output: 15 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5)

```

## destructuring and destructuring Arrays ?

https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/destructuring-in-javascript/

Destructuring is a feature in JavaScript that allows you to extract values from arrays, objects, and other structures into distinct variables.

Destructuring Arrays is the process of breaking down an array into individual elements, and assigning those elements to separate variables. This can be done using array destructuring syntax, which uses square brackets on the left-hand side of the assignment operator to specify the variables to which the array elements should be assigned.

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];

// Destructuring the array into individual variables
const [a, b, c] = numbers;

console.log(a); // Output: 1
console.log(b); // Output: 2
console.log(c); // Output: 3

```

## Optional Chaining ?
Optional Chaining is a feature in JavaScript that allows developers to access object properties without worrying about whether the object is null or undefined. It is denoted by the question mark (?) and the dot (.) operator.

```js
const user = {
  name: 'John',
  address: {
    street: '123 Main St',
    city: 'New York'
  }
};

// Accessing nested property using Optional Chaining
const country = user?.address?.country;

console.log(country); // Output: undefined

```

## Functional Programming in JavaScript 🛠

A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task and can accept inputs (arguments) and return an output (a result)

Just like how we used variables to store values, we can use functions to store a piece of code which we can reuse.

**You can make function in two ways:**
```javascript
function a(){
 console.log('I am a normal function');
 }
 
const b = () => {
console.log('I am an arrow function')
}

// They are essentially the same but with a few differences which we will cover as we go along this tutorial. 

// We can pass variables as arguments

const c = (name) => {
console.log(`My name is ${name}`)
}

// `` template literal are a new addition to the language. Very useful for string formatting. Values are accessed using ${} inside them.


// We can even pass functions as arguments to a function. Will see more on this when we try to understand closures.

const greet = () =>  {
    const prefix = 'Mr'
    return (name) => {
        console.log(`${prefix} ${name}, welcome!`)
    }
}

console.log(greet()('Jack'))
```
Now, let's cover some important concepts related to functions.
 ## Difference between Function and Function Expression
 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6b6aab4-2ffb-41da-bdfc-0125b2c4e10a)

 ## Disadvantages of callback functions
1)Callback hell 2)Inversion Control 3)Error Handling complexity 4)Tight Coupling and Less Flexibility
5)Difficult to Use with Modern Asynchronous Patterns
While callbacks can be useful, their disadvantages often make them less practical in complex asynchronous flows. Promises and async/await provide cleaner, more readable alternatives to manage asynchronous behavior in JavaScript applications.
## Function Scope in JavaScript 🕵️

Scope determines from where the variables are accessible.

**There are three types of scope:**

Global (declaration outside of any function)
Function (declaration inside a function)
Block (declaration inside a block)
Remember from before that var is globally scoped whereas let and const are block scoped. Let's understand that now.

```javascript

var a = 5 // we can access this a anywhere

function adder(){
    let b = 7
    console.log(a + b)
 }
 
console.log(adder())

console.log(b) // Error as b is not accessible outside the function

{
const c = 10
console.log(c) // 10
}

console.log(c) // Error as c is not accessible outside the block
```

## *this* keyword in js

*this* keyword refers to the context in which a function is called.
* **Global Context  :-** In the global context (i.e., outside of any function), this refers to the global object, which is window in browsers and global in 
                         Node.js.
  ```js
  console.log(this); // returns window obj in browser and {} in node.js because this refers to the module context (in Node.js).
  ```
* **Function Context :-** When a function is called normally, this refers to the global object if the function is not part of an object.
  ```js
  function showThis() {
    console.log(this); // In a browser, logs the `window` object
  }

  showThis();
  ```
* **Object Method Context :-** When a function is a method of an object (i.e., a property of an object and called using dot notation), *this* refers to the 
    object that owns the method.
  ```js
  const person = {
    name: 'Alice',
    greet() {
        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
    }
  };

  person.greet(); // `this` refers to the `person` object

  ```
## ** method used to merge two objects obj1 and obj2 into new object
Using the Spread Operator (...):

const obj1 = { a: 1, b: 2 };
const obj2 = { b: 3, c: 4 };

const mergedObj = { ...obj1, ...obj2 };
console.log(mergedObj); // { a: 1, b: 3, c: 4 }

If there are properties with the same key (like b in this example), the value from the later object (obj2) will overwrite the earlier one (obj1), resulting in b: 3.

Using Object.assign():
Object.assign() is an older method that merges objects. It takes two or more objects as arguments and merges them into the first object. To avoid mutating the original objects, you can pass an empty object as the first argument, which acts as the target.

const obj1 = { a: 1, b: 2 };
const obj2 = { b: 3, c: 4 };

const mergedObj = Object.assign({}, obj1, obj2);
console.log(mergedObj); // { a: 1, b: 3, c: 4 }


* **Arrow Functions :-** 1. In arrow functions, *this* behaves differently than in regular functions. It does not change depending on the calling context.
                         2. Instead, it keeps the value of *this* from the outer (lexical) context where the arrow function is defined.
  ```js
  const person = {
    name: 'Alice',
    greet: () => {
        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
    }
  };

  person.greet(); // `this` does not refer to the `person` object, likely logs `undefined` or `Hello, my name is` because `this` is from the outer context.

  ```
* **Constructor Functions :-** In a constructor function, *this* refers to the newly created object.
  ```js
  function Person(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  const alice = new Person('Alice');
  console.log(alice.name); // Logs: Alice

  ```

* **Event Handlers :-** In event handlers, *this* refers to the element that received the event (e.g., the button clicked).
  ```js
  const button = document.getElementById('myButton');
  button.addEventListener('click', function() {
    console.log(this); // Logs the button element (`button`)
  });
  
  ```
* **Explicitly Changing this :-** You can explicitly change the value of this using methods such as call(), apply(), or bind().
  ```js
  function greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}`);
  }

  const person = { name: 'Alice' };
  greet.call(person); // `this` is set to the `person` object

  ``` 

## Difference between Normal function and Arrow function

![image](https://github.com/AwaizMd/Notes/assets/72355688/922eea49-b61a-4019-a342-f25e61063a43)

## constructor in js


A constructor function in JavaScript serves as a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior of objects that will be created using it. When you create an object with a constructor function, you're essentially creating an instance of the blueprint defined by that function.

```js
function Person(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    this.sayHello = function() {
        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`);
    };
}

const person1 = new Person('Alice', 30);
const person2 = new Person('Bob', 25);

person1.sayHello(); // Output: Hello, my name is Alice and I am 30 years old.
person2.sayHello(); // Output: Hello, my name is Bob and I am 25 years old.

```

## rest operator
 It is used to gather multiple elements into a single array. It allows you to handle an arbitrary number of arguments more flexibly, especially in function parameters or array destructuring.

 ```js
// When used in function parameters, the rest operator gathers all remaining arguments into an array.
function sum(...numbers) {
    let result = 0;
    for (let number of numbers) {
        result += number;
    }
    return result;
}

console.log(sum(1, 2, 3)); // Output: 6
console.log(sum(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)); // Output: 15

// When used in array destructuring, the rest operator collects the remaining elements into a new array.

const [first, second, ...rest] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

console.log(first); // Output: 1
console.log(second); // Output: 2
console.log(rest); // Output: [3, 4, 5]

```

## spread operator
* It is used to expand an iterable (like an array) into individual elements. It's the counterpart to the rest parameter, which gathers elements into an array.
* You can use the spread operator to create a shallow copy of an array.
``` js
const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
const arr2 = [4, 5, 6];
const combinedArray = [...arr1, ...arr2];

console.log(combinedArray); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]


shallow copy:
const originalArray = [1, 2, 3];
const copiedArray = [...originalArray];

console.log(copiedArray); // Output: [1, 2, 3]


```


## What is a Set
It allows you to store unique values of any type, whether primitive values or object references. The values can be added or removed from the Set, and you can also check if a value exists in the Set using its methods. Unlike arrays, Sets are not ordered and do not have indexes.

how to create a Set
To create a set in JavaScript, you can use the built-in Set object. Here's an example:
```js
const mySet = new Set([1, 2, 3]);
```
In this example, mySet is a Set object that contains the values 1, 2, and 3.

You can also create an empty set and add values to it using the add() method:
```js
const mySet = new Set();
mySet.add(4);
mySet.add(5);
mySet.add(6);
```
## Deep copy and Shallow copy

**shallow copy:** It creates a new object, but if the original object contains nested objects (or arrays), only references to those nested objects are copied, not the objects themselves. Therefore, changes made to nested objects in the copy will also affect the original object (and vice versa).

**deep copy:**  It creates a new object where all properties and nested objects are duplicated, not just their references. Changes made to the copied object (or any of its nested objects) will not affect the original object, and vice versa.


## Closures in JavaScript (❗important) 🔒
We have already used a closure without even realizing it. In the example below, prefix is a closed-over-variable.
A closure is a function that is bind to its lexical environment
*In Simple words:- A closure is a function that captures the variables from its surrounding lexical scope (the context in which it was defined). This means that a closure can access variables defined in its outer scope, even after the outer function has completed execution.*
*When a function is defined inside another function, the inner function forms a closure and "closes over" the outer function's variables. This allows the inner function to use and manipulate those variables, even if the outer function has finished executing.*

```javascript
const greet = () =>  {
    const prefix = 'Mr'
    return (name) => {
        console.log(`${prefix} ${name}, welcome!`)
    }
}

console.log(greet()('Jack'))
```
This section will have a lot of fancy words, so bear with me. We will cover them one by one.

MDN says:

A function bundled together with its lexical environment forms a closure.


Okay, what is a lexical environment?

It is essentially the surrounding state – the local memory along with the lexical environment of its parent.

Whaaat? 🤯 I know it's a bit of a doozy. Let's understand it with a simple example.

```javascript
function x() {
  var a = 7
  function y() {
    console.log(a)
  }
  return y
}

var z = x()
console.log(z) // [Function: y]
z()
```
When x is invoked, y is returned. Now, y is waiting to be executed. Kind of like a loaded gun waiting to be shot! 🔫

So, when we finally invoke z, y is invoked. Now, y has to log a so it first tries to find 🔍 it in the local memory but it's not there. It goes to its parent function. It finds a there.

Even when functions are returned (in the above case y) they still remember their lexical scope (where it came from)

**Advantages of Closures in JavaScript 😎**

Currying is a functional programming technique that transforms a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of functions, each taking a single argument. In other words, a curried function takes an argument and returns a new function that takes the next argument, and so on, until all arguments have been provided.
```javascript
// Regular function
function multiply(a, b) {
    return a * b;
}

// Currying the function
function curryMultiply(a) {
    return function(b) {
        return a * b;
    };
}

// Using the curried function
const multiplyByTwo = curryMultiply(2); // Returns a function that multiplies by 2
const result = multiplyByTwo(5); // Returns 10

console.log(result); // Outputs: 10

```
**Data Hiding/Encapsulation**

* Data hiding is achieved by keeping certain variables private within the scope of an outer function.
* The outer function returns an object that contains methods (inner functions) for accessing or manipulating the private variables.
* The private variables are not directly accessible from outside the outer function, ensuring they remain hidden and protected.

Suppose you want to create a counter application. Every time you call it, the count increases by 1. But you don't want to expose the variable outside the function. How to do it?

*You guessed it – closures!*

```javascript
function Counter() {
  var count = 0
  this.incrementCount = function () {
    count++
    console.log(count)
  }
}

console.log(count) // Error: count is not defined
var adder = new Counter()
adder.incrementCount() // 1
```
Don't worry about this and new. We have a whole section devoted to them down below.

## Disadvantages of Closures in JavaScript 😅

* Overconsumption of memory or memory leaks can happen.
  
For example, the closed-over-variable will not be garbage collected. This is because, even if the outer function has run, the returned inner function still has a reference to the closed-over-variable.

*Note: Garbage collection basically removes unused variables from the memory automatically.*

## Hoisting in JavaScript 
This is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top of the program.

var declaration is hoisted up and initialized with undefined.
let and const declarations are hoisted up but not initialized.
function definitions are also hoisted up and stored as they are.
Let's look at an example:
```javascript
function consoleNum() {
  console.log(num)
  var num = 10
}

consoleNum() // undefined

// Why no error?

// This is how runtime sees this
{
  var num
  console.log(num)
  num = 9
}

// If instead of var -> let, it will give an error as let values are not initialized
```
## Objects in JavaScript 🔮
Just like arrays, objects are a way of storing data. We do so with the help of key-value pairs.

```javascript
    const developer = {
        name: "Raj",
        age: 22
        }
```
name is the key and Raj is the value. Keys are generally the name of the properties of the object.

We can store all sorts of data like functions inside an object. You can explore more here on the MDN.

## What is this in JavaScript?
Now, working with objects is different in JS than in other popular programming languages like C++. And to understand that properly, we need a good grasp of the this keyword.

Let's try to understand it step-by-step.

In a program, at times, we need a way to point at stuff. Like saying this function right here belongs to this object. this helps us get this context.

You will understand what I am saying better when we look at some examples.

For now, think of this as something which provides context. And remember this important thing: its value depends on how and where it is called.

I know, I know. A lot of this 😬. Let's go over all this slowly.

Start a new program and just log this.


console.log(this)

It will point to the window object.

Now, let's take an example with an object:
```javascript
function myFunc() {
    console.log(this)     
  }
 
const obj = {
  bool: true,
  myFunc: myFunc,
}

obj.myFunc()
Now, this will point to the object. So what's happening here?

In the first example, we had nothing left of the . so it defaulted to the window object. But in this example, we have the object obj.

If you do:


myFunc() // window
```
We again get the window object. So, we can see that the value of this depends on how and where are we doing the calling.

What we just did above is called Implicit Binding. The value of this got bound to the object.

There is another way to use this. Explicit binding is when you force a function to use a certain object as its this.

Let's understand why we need explicit binding through an example.

```javascript
const student_1 =  {
    name: 'Randall',
    displayName_1: function displayName() {
        console.log(this.name)
    }
}
const student_2 =  {
    name: 'Raj',
    displayName_2: function displayName() {
        console.log(this.name)
    }
}

student_1.displayName_1()
student_2.displayName_2()
```
We are using this properly, but can you see the problem with the above code?

We are repeating code. And one of the principles of good programming is keep your code DRY! (Don't Repeat Yourself)

So, let's get rid of displayName_2 and simply do:


student_1.displayName_1.call(student_2) // Raj

call forced displayName_1 to use the second object as its this.

There are a lot of other ways we can do this.

Try to solve the given problem yourself.

``` javascript
const myData = {
  name: 'Rajat',
  city: 'Delhi',
  displayStay: function () {
    console.log(this.name, 'stays in', this.city)
  },
}
myData.displayStay()

// create an object yourData and try to use displayStay
const yourData = {
 name: 'name',
 city: 'city'
}


// answer
myData.displayStay.call(yourData)
```
Finally, remember that I said that there are differences between arrow and regular functions.

The case of this is one of them.

For an arrow function, the value depends on the lexical scope – that is to say, the outer function where the arrow function is declared.

So, if we make the displayName() from above an arrow function, nothing will work.

*Arrow functions basically inherit the parent's context which in the above case is the window.*


## call, apply and bind

**call() & apply** : 
* call() and apply() are used to invoke functions with a specified context (this value) and arguments, where as in call arguments provided individually and in apply arguments provided in array
```js
// call()

const person = {
    fullName: function(city, country) {
        return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + ", " + city + ", " + country;
    }
}

const person1 = {
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Doe"
}

const person2 = {
    firstName: "Jane",
    lastName: "Doe"
}

// Using call to invoke the function with different context
console.log(person.fullName.call(person1, "New York", "USA")); // Output: John Doe, New York, USA
console.log(person.fullName.call(person2, "London", "UK")); // Output: Jane Doe, London, UK


//apply()
const numbers = [5, 10, 15];

// Using apply to find the maximum value in the array
const max = Math.max.apply(null, numbers);
console.log(max); // Output: 15


```
**bind()** : it creates a new function with a fixed context, which can be invoked later.

```js
const person = {
    fullName: function() {
        return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
    }
}

const person1 = {
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Doe"
}

const person2 = {
    firstName: "Jane",
    lastName: "Doe"
}

// Using bind to create a new function with a fixed context
const person1FullName = person.fullName.bind(person1);
const person2FullName = person.fullName.bind(person2);

console.log(person1FullName()); // Output: John Doe
console.log(person2FullName()); // Output: Jane Doe


```

## Prototypes and Prototypal Inheritance in JavaScript 👪
Prototypes in JavaScript are a fundamental concept that allows objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects. Every JavaScript object has a prototype, which is an object from which it inherits properties.

All this comes via prototypes.

__proto__ is the object where JS is putting it all.

Let's see some examples. Fire up your consoles!

```js
let arr = ['Rajat', 'Raj']
console.log(arr.__proto__.forEach)
console.log(arr.__proto__) // same as Array.prototype
console.log(arr.__proto__.__proto__) // same as Object.prototype
console.log(arr.__proto__.__proto__.__proto__) // null
All this is called a prototype chain.
```

We can do the same with objects and functions as well.

We will always find Object.prototype behind the scenes. That's why you may have heard that everything in JS is an object. 🤯

What is Prototypal Inheritance in JavaScript?

JavaScript uses prototype-based inheritance, where objects inherit properties and methods from their prototype. This allows for code reuse and the creation of hierarchies of objects with shared behavior.

```js
let object = {
  name: 'Rajat',
  city: 'Delhi',
  getIntro: function () {
    console.log(`${this.name}, ${this.city}`)
  },
}

let object2 = {
  name: 'Aditya',
}
Note: Don't modify prototypes this way. It's just for understanding. Here's the right way to do it.

object2.__proto__ = object
By doing this, object2 gets access to the object's properties. So, now we can do:

console.log(object2.city)
This is prototypal inheritance.
```

## Asynchronous JavaScript ⚡
So, JS is a single-threaded language. Things happen one at a time. Only after one thing is done can we move to the next thing.

But this creates problems in the real world, especially, when we are working with browsers.

For example, when we need to fetch data from the web - often times we don't know how long will it take to get it. And whether we will be able to get the data successfully.

To help with this, asynchronous JS comes into play.

And the most important concept to understand is the event loop.

Event Loops in JavaScript ➰
Instead of providing a half-baked explanation here, I highly recommend reading top link to understand js working.

Learn all about event loops in above links.

**Timers in JavaScript – setTimeout, setInterval, clearInterval ⏱️**
I hope you read from the link.

The setTimeout() method calls a function or evaluates an expression after a specified number of milliseconds.

setInterval() does the same for specified intervals.

```js
setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('Here - I am after 2 seconds')
}, 2000);

const timer = setInterval(() => {
    console.log('I will keep on coming back until you clear me')
}, 2000);

You use clearInterval() to stop the timer.

clearInterval(timer)
Let's go over some questions that use these concepts.

  console.log('Hello')
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('lovely')
  }, 0)
  console.log('reader')

  // output
  Hello
  reader
  lovely
Here's a slightly trickier one:

  for (var i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    setTimeout(function () {
      console.log(i)
    }, i * 1000)
  }

// output
6
6
6
6
6
```
And here's a short explanation of what's going on there: when setTimeout comes again into the picture, the entire loop has run and the value of i has become 6,

Now, let's say we want the outcome to be 1 2 3 4 5 – what do we do?

*Instead of var ➡️ use let.*

Why this will work?

var is globally scoped but let is locally scoped. So for let a new i is created for every iteration.

## Promises in JavaScript (❗important) 🤝

Promises in JavaScript provide a way to handle asynchronous operations more easily and cleanly. They allow  to work with asynchronous code in a more sequential and predictable manner.
The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

A promise can be in one of these three states:

Pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected
Fulfilled: operation was completed successfully
Rejected: operation failed
```js
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  let value = true
  if (value) {
    resolve('hey value is true')
  } else {
    reject('there was an error, value is false')
  }
})

promise
  .then((x) => {
    console.log(x)
  })
  .catch((err) => console.log(err))
Note: resolve and reject are just conventional names. Call it pizza🍕 if you like.

Instead of then/catch, we can also use async/await:

async function asyncCall() {
  const result = await promise
  console.log(result)
}

asyncCall()
```
One of the advantages of async await is that they are a much cleaner syntax. Before we had promises, we could easily get stuck in callback hell 🌋

## Advanced JavaScript Concepts to Know

### 📚 Polyfills in JavaScript
A polyfill is a piece of code (usually JavaScript on the Web) used to provide modern functionality on older browsers that do not natively support it. MDN

Let's implement it for map:
```js
// this - array
// this[i] - current value
Array.prototype.myMap = function (cb) {
  var arr = []
  for (var i = 0; i < this.length; i++) {
    arr.push(cb(this[i], i, this))
  }
  return arr
}

const arr = [1, 2, 3]
console.log(arr.myMap((a) => a * 2)) // [2, 4, 6]
```
Notice how we use this. Here, we have basically created a new array and are adding values to it.

## Async and defer in JavaScript ✔️
These concepts are frequently asked about in interviews by big corporations like Amazon, Walmart, and Flipkart. 🏢

To understand async and defer, we need to have an idea of how browsers render a webpage. First, they parse the HTML and CSS. Then DOM trees are created. From these, a render tree is created. Finally, from the render tree - a layout is created and the painting happens.

For a more detailed look, check out this video.

Async and defer are boolean attributes which can be loaded along with the script tags. They are useful for loading external scripts into your web page.

Let's understand with the help of pictures.

![image](https://github.com/AwaizMd/Notes/assets/72355688/d7ba75e4-1ffd-4e91-83c8-b03887185adc)

If there are multiple scripts which are dependant on each other, use defer. Defer script are executed in the order which they are defined.

If you want to load external script which is not dependant on the execution of any other scripts, use async.

Note: The async attribute does not guarantee the order of execution of scripts.

## Debouncing in JavaScript ⛹️‍♂️
Debouncing is another favorite topic of interviewers.

Let's understand it by creating a search bar.

Demo: https://codesandbox.io/s/debounce-input-field-o5gml

Create a simple input field in index.html like this:

<input type='text' id='text' />
Now, in index.js. Don't forget to add it to index.html first:
```js
const getData = (e) => {
  console.log(e.target.value)
}
const inputField = document.getElementById('text')

const debounce = function (fn, delay) {
  let timer
  return function () {
    let context = this
    clearTimeout(timer)
    timer = setTimeout(() => {
      fn.apply(context, arguments)
    }, delay)
  }
}
inputField.addEventListener('keyup', debounce(getData, 300))
```
First, we have selected the input and added an event listener to it. Then we created a debounce function which takes a callback function and delay.

Now, inside the debounce function we create a timer using setTimeout. Now, this timer's job is to make sure that the next call for getData only happens after 300 ms. This is what debouncing is.

Also, we use clearTimeout to remove it. Don't want too many of them hanging out there taking up memory space!

Phew! Lots of theory. Let's do a fun challenge. You must have seen the countdown before a game starts (it goes like 10, 9, 8, .... with some delay in between). Try to write a program for it.

Here's how you'd do it:
```js
let count = 10

for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  function timer(i) {
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log(count)
      count--
    }, i * 500)
  }
  timer(i)
}
```
Were you able to solve it? Did you do it differently? Let me know your solution.

## Throttling in JavaScript 🛑
Let's look at an example again. Suppose that on every window resize event we call an expensive function. Now, we want it such that the expensive function will only be executed once in the given time interval. This is what throttling is.

Create an index.html and an index.js with the following code:
```js
const expensive = () => {
  console.log('expensive')
}

const throttle = (fn, limit) => {
  let context = this
  let flag = true
  return function () {
    if (flag) {
      fn.apply(context, arguments)
      flag = false
    }
    setTimeout(() => {
      flag = true
    }, limit)
  }
}
const func = throttle(expensive, 2000)
window.addEventListener('resize', func)
```
Almost the same as debouncing. The key difference is the flag variable. Only, when it's true we are invoking the callback function. And it is set to true inside the setTimeout. So the value is true only after the desired time limit.

So, what's the difference between debounce and throttling❓
Let's take the search bar 🔍 example from above. When we are debouncing the input field, we are saying to only fetch the data when the difference between two keyup events is at least 300 ms.

In the case of throttling, we make a function call only after a certain period of time.

Suppose that you are searching for an encyclopedia in the search bar. The first call is made on e and it took us 300 ms to reach p. The next call will be made then only. All the events in between will be ignored.

So, to summarize, debouncing is when the difference between two keyup events is 300 ms. And throttling is when the difference between two function calls is 300 ms. Basically, the function is called after a certain interval of time.

## Storage in JavaScript 💾
Finally, a small but important topic to wrap things up.

localStorage: Data persists even after closing your session

sessionStorage: You lose your data when your session is over, like when you close the browser on the tab.
```js
// save
localStorage.setItem('key', 'value')
// get saved data
let data = localStorage.getItem('key')
// remove saved data
localStorage.removeItem('key')
// Same for sessionStorage
```
## ** Enum
In TypeScript, an enum (short for "enumeration") is a feature that allows you to define a set of named constants
This is useful when you want to represent a collection of related values, like states, options, or flags, with meaningful names rather than using raw numbers or strings directly in your code 
## Namaste JavaScript
 Lexical Environment = local memory + lexical env of its parent. Hence, Lexical Environement is the local memory along with the lexical environment of its parent
 function a(){ // a is in lexical environment of global
 var b=10;
 c();
 function c(){  //c is in lexical environment of a
 consol.log(b)
 }
 }
 a();
*Whenever an Execution Context is created, a Lexical environment(LE) is also created and is referenced in the local Execution Context(in memory space)
*The process of going one by one to parent and checking for values is called scope chain or Lexcial environment chain
# TLDR; An inner function can access variables which are in outer functions even if inner function is nested deep. In any other case, a function can't access variables not in its scope.
## Closures
It is a function which is bind to its lexical environment
